The logictools package is here! If you find yourself typesetting formal logic often, you should check it out! 
The star of the show is the formallogic environment, that makes it easy and fast to typeset good looking logic.

Prior to the development of this environment, spending way too much time fiddling around with spacing commands 
was a familiar experience for every logician. Most of the spacing you need in a logical statement is context 
sensitive, so only so much can be done through basic macros. Furthermore, using too many macros destroys the 
readability of the code, and slows down writing to a crawl.

In an effort to change this, I wrote an environment that both speeds up writing formal logic (by offering 
shorter syntax) and improves the output considerably. The details of how this works will be presented in the 
upcoming sections. The default settings were made with LaTeX's default math font in mind, with the intention 
that the user come up with a preset that matches their preferences. The options can be changed on the fly, so 
more than one preset can be used in different parts of the document.

Other than this, the option `oxford' will load a few neat macros that might be of particular interest to those 
studying logic at the University of Oxford; they provide shortcuts to notations that are commonly used in the 
first-year courses.
